<br>
- Experience in designing various analog circuits in deep-submicron process
- Designed low-noise, high-bandwidth current-mode capacitive Analog Front End for low-cost fingerprint sensors
- Implemented a novel current-mode mixer topology to improve SNR
- Architected and designed a experimental low-area, ultra-low power reference architecture to reduce standby current by an order of magnitude without reducing performance
- Designed small area and high-performance baseline correction circuit for Touch and TDDI chips 
- Circuit design and system-level experience in touch sensing front-ends, display drivers, and fingerprint sensing front-ends
- Designed a sub 1-V bandgap reference with an innovative base-cancellation circuit that generates multiple configurable references for next-generation TDDI products.  Currently in mass production on multiple ASICs
- Responsible for the design of critical low-noise, high-performance touch sensing circuits for analog front-end including demodulator, filter, and various amplifiers for TDDI products currently in mass production
- Experience working with multi-functional teams in order to ensure smooth IC bring-up through to production
- Responsible for driving completion of high-speed MIPI D-PHY SERDES architecture from transistor-level design through physical implementation, up to top-level verification and production testing.

**Rochester Institute of Technology** <span style="color: gray">in</span> Rochester, NY <span style="color: gray">from</span> Sep 2008 to Aug 2013
<br>
**Master of Science** and Bachelor of Science <span style="color: gray">with a graduate</span> GPA <span style="color: gray">of</span> 4.0

Thesis: ***Stability Analysis of Switched DC-DC Boost Converters for Integrated Circuits***
- Investigated small-signal modeling and stability requirements for boost converters, as well as a variety of OTA-based controller topologies, in order to aid in the design and measurement of boost converter stability on an ASIC.  Also investigated use of genetic algorithms as a way to optimize controller design.
